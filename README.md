# LLM-Powered-Q-A-and-Text-Generation-System
This project is an AI-powered question-answering and text generation system built using LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4, and Hugging Face FLAN-T5. It integrates multiple language models to provide dynamic and context-aware responses.

## Features
* Supports both open-source and paid models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Hugging Face FLAN-T5).
* Easily switch between APIs by replacing the API key in the config.
* Prompt Engineering techniques (Prompt Templates, LLMChain, Sequential Chains, Output Parsers) to optimize response accuracy.
* Multi-step workflows using Sequential Chains to handle complex interactions.
* ChatModels with ChatOpenAI for dynamic and contextual conversations.

## Usage
* To use OpenAI GPT-4, replace OPENAI_API_KEY with your own key from OpenAI.
* For free models like Hugging Faceâ€™s FLAN-T5, you can obtain an API key from Hugging Face.
* Modify the .env or configuration file to use your preferred LLM.
